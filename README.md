## Description
This is a Triangle Tracker
## BDD
It simply means,you have to enter the lenght of three sides and track whether is an equilateral, once all sides are equal,either isoscele if two of these sides are equal and not triangle if none of the side are equal to one. otherwise it is scalene triangle. you will find in my program , for example if you enter like three equal sides and click to result it will bring an alter message to tell you that ,it is an equilateral triangle, if you enter two equal sides of the three the alert message will tell you  it is an isosceles triangle and so on.
